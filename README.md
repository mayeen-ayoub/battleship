# Battleship
Battleship is a game where two players guess where the other has placed their ships. On a 10 by 10 grid, a player decides where to place their ships. The ships, including the Carrier (5), the Battleship (4), the Cruiser (3), the Submarine (3), the Destroyer (2), are hidden from the other player. The other player has to guess where their opponent has placed the ship. The game alternates between both players until one playerâ€™s ships are all gone. The player that sunk all the ships is the winner.
